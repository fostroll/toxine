A part of ***RuMor*** project. It contains pipeline for preprocessing and
tokenization texts in *Russian*. Also, it includes preliminary entity tagging.
Highlights are:

* Extracting emojis, emails, dates, phones, urls, html/xml fragments etc.
* Tagging/removing tokens with unallowed symbols
* Normalizing punctuation
* Tokenization (via *NLTK*)
* Russan *Wikipedia* tokenizer
* [*brat*](https://brat.nlplab.org/) annotations support

## Installation

### pip

***Toxine*** supports *Python 3.5* or later. To install it via *pip*, run:
```sh
$ pip install toxine
```

If you currently have a previous version of ***Toxine*** installed, use:
```sh
$ pip install toxine -U
```

### From Source

Alternatively, you can also install ***Toxine*** from source of this *git
repository*:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/fostroll/toxine.git
$ cd toxine
$ pip install -e .
```
This gives you access to examples that are not included to the *PyPI* package.

## Setup

***Toxine*** uses *NLTK* with *punkt* data downloaded. If you didn't do it yet,
start *Python* interpreter and execute:
```python
>>> import nltk
>>> nltk.download('punkt')
```

**NB:** If you plan to use methods for *brat* annotations renewal, you need to
install the
[*python-Levenshtein*](https://pypi.org/project/python-Levenshtein/) library.
See more on the
[*brat* annotations support](https://github.com/fostroll/toxine/blob/master/doc/README_BRAT.md)
page.
